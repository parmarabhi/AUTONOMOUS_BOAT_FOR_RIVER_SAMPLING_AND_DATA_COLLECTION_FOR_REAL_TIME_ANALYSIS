# AUTONOMOUS_BOAT_FOR_RIVER_SAMPLING_AND_DATA_COLLECTION_FOR_REAL_TIME_ANALYSIS
Autonomous boat for river sampling and data collection for real time analysis
It Uses Fusion of Two Sensors IMU( BNO055 )and GPS (Neo 7M ) with the help of Kalman Filter and Arduino Uno for
accurate location of samples where it has been taken.
I Used 2D LIDAR For Object Detection in the Water Surface Which Require 's a Microprocessor so i have used Rasberry
Pi 4 for Data processing and Distance calculation from Objects the Lidar sends signal to Motor Driver( LM 298 ) for
Controlling the Direction of Boat.
